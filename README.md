# Binary search tree using C

- [x] add -  Add the given key and object to hash table. If key exists, update the value(**iterative and recursion versions**)
- [x] find - Finds key in tree(**iterative and recursion versions**)
- [x] min - Returns node with min key(**iterative and recursion versions**)
- [x] max - Returns node with max key(**iterative and recursion versions**)
- [x] height - Returns the height of the tree in nodes, 0 if empty(**iterative and recursion versions**)
- [x] count - Returns the number of nodes stored in the tree(**iterative and recursion versions**)
- [x] successor - Returns the node that contains next key
- [x] predecessor - Returns the node contains previous key 
- [x] pre_order_travers - Visits nodes in preorder(root, left, right)
- [x] in_order_travers - Visits nodes in preorder(left, root, right)
- [x] post_order_travers - Visits nodes in preorder(left, right, root)
- [x] init -  Init banary tree data structure
- [x] delete - Frees memory in data structure
